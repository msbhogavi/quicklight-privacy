# Privacy Policy – QuickLight

**Last updated:** February 11, 2026

QuickLight is designed with privacy in mind. All gesture detection happens entirely on your device — no sensor data ever leaves your phone.

## What We Collect

QuickLight uses **Google Firebase Analytics** to collect anonymous usage data that helps us improve the app. This includes:

- **App events**: gesture triggers, torch toggles, service starts, and gesture rejections (reason only, e.g. "user_moving")
- **Device info**: device model, operating system version, app version (collected automatically by Firebase)
- **Session data**: app open/close times, session duration

## What We Do NOT Collect

- No personal information (name, email, phone number, accounts)
- No location data
- No photos, videos, or audio
- No contacts or messages
- No raw sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope readings never leave the device)
- No advertising ID for ad targeting

## Third-Party Services

QuickLight uses the following Google services:

- **Firebase Analytics** — anonymous usage statistics ([Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy))
- **Firebase Remote Config** — remote tuning of gesture parameters (no user data sent)
- **Google Play Services Activity Recognition** — detects walking/running to prevent false triggers (processed on-device, not transmitted)

## Data Retention

Firebase Analytics data is retained for 2 months by default. No data is sold or shared with advertisers.

## Ads

QuickLight contains no advertisements.

## Camera & Flash

The app uses the device camera hardware **only** to control the flashlight LED. No photos, videos, or images are captured or recorded.

## Your Control

- You can disable analytics by revoking network access for QuickLight in your device settings
- You can reset your advertising ID via your device's privacy settings
- All gesture detection works fully offline

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new date.
