## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Analytics Data (Firebase Analytics)
We collect anonymous usage data to improve the App:
* App events: gesture triggers, torch toggles, service starts, gesture rejections (reason only, e.g., "user_moving")
* Device info: device model, operating system version, app version (collected automatically by Firebase)
* Session data: app open/close times, session duration

### 1.2 Crash Data (Firebase Crashlytics)
We collect anonymous crash reports to fix bugs:
* Stack traces, exception types, crash timestamps
* Device model, OS version, app version, available memory
* No personal information is included in crash reports

### 1.3 Remote Configuration (Firebase Remote Config)
We use Firebase Remote Config to remotely tune gesture detection parameters. No user data is sent to this service.

### 1.4 Activity Recognition (Google Play Services)
The App uses on-device Activity Recognition to detect movement states (e.g., walking, running) and prevent false gesture triggers. This data is processed entirely on your device and is never transmitted.

### 1.5 Sensor Data
The App accesses accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity, and ambient light sensors. All sensor data is processed entirely on your device and never leaves it.
